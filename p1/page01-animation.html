  <h4>Perfect In Its Imperfection</h4>
  <p>
    In these pixelated animations, one can appreciate the charm of low resolution. 
    In an era accustomed to highly polished animation, such works boldly reveal their 
    imperfections. That very audacious imperfection can, paradoxically, feel liberating. 
    <br><br>
    Much like how a child’s absurd doodle can sometimes feel more appealing than a 
    realistically rendered still life…</p>

  <br><i>Video man, <span class="info">Jack Stauber
    <span class="popup-text">mainly works on computer-drawn animated music videos 
      and is best known for his use of VHS effects. His childlike drawing 
      style and absurd, contextless narratives make his works iconic. 
      What makes them especially appealing is that they often focus not on conventionally
      valuable or objective subjects, but on trivial and meaningless moments, which blend perfectly 
      with the low resolution and rough video texture.
      <br><br>
      In works like Work, where an office worker sings instead of concentrating, or Videoman, 
      where a man trapped inside a screen feels jealous of people who live freely, 
      Stauber captures strangely funny moments rather than serious stories. 
      The fuzzy image quality matches his wavy drawing style, and the noisy voice recordings, 
      which sound as if they were made with a cheap microphone, make the videos even more compelling and authentic.

    <span class="info">Same as it ever before
      <span class="popup-text">immediately caught my attention, and I couldn’t just scroll 
        past the thumbnail. In it, a purple Yoshi walks and dances in a strangely spinning square 
        space, perfectly synced with the repeating rhythm and syllables of The Talking Heads’ 
          Once in a Lifetime.The slightly low resolution and raw editing style seem to amplify 
          its addictive charm even more.

    <span class="info"> خبزه وطماطيه 
      <span class="popup-text">, which means Tomato and Bread
         is most striking for its pixelated tomatoes. 
         There is no major storyline, just tomatoes moving and some 2D drawings,
        yet it conveys an indescribable sense of humor. The absurd context and pixelated scenes 
        come together in a way that leaves an even stronger impression.
