    <h4>Time Manipulating Device</h4>
    <p>
        Camcorder footage with its old, textured look makes the present feel like the past. 
        Once recorded, even current moments become memories. 
        The footage isn’t truly old, yet it can still evoke nostalgia, warmth, and a hint of sadness.

        <br><br>This might be why camcorders are often used in lyrical or dreamy music. 
        Their appeal lies not in telling some grand story, but in capturing personal memories, 
        giving a sense of intimacy and emotional depth.

        <span class="popup-text">, an indie pop song, 
          adds a warm touch to the video along with the old TV noise.
          Watching the woman run and play on the beach feels joyful, yet the cloudy, 
          rainy weather and the slow-motion effect evoke a sense of melancholy. 
          The camcorder-like texture makes me imagine someone yearning for and missing moments 
          of happiness with another person.<br><br>

  <br><i><span class="info">Memory
    <span class="popup-text">by 92914 is a music video filmed entirely with a camcorder, 
      which goes well with the slow tempo of the song. Since it has no lyrics, 
      the viewer can focus more on the peaceful flow of the scenes and the visual atmosphere. 
      The camcorder effect adds a nostalgic feeling that fits perfectly with the title. 
      I was especially drawn to the close-up of hair swaying in the wind. 
      It showed that even without grand scenery, something as small as a strand of hair 
      can create a dreamy and sentimental mood.<br><br>

  <br><i><span class="info">Dandelions forever
    <span class="popup-text">came up through the YouTube algorithm and 
      I couldn’t scroll past it because I was instantly drawn in by its mood. 
      As someone who has a cat, watching it walk through a field of dandelions under the sunlight 
      and slowly approach the camera warmed my heart.
      At the same time, it felt a little bittersweet, as if I were looking back on memories with my cat after 
      it had gone to heaven..(as if it had already happened.) The gentle ambient sounds, along with the joyful dog 
      and the calm cat interacting peacefully, made the whole scene feel even more serene. <br><br>

      is different from the previous three videos because the cuts are rapid 
      and multiple clips are mixed together like archival footage. 
      In keeping with the song’s concept of the passage of time, various scenes that indicate the time such as candles,
      eaten apples, a hospital room, and sewing are interwoven in a seemingly chaotic way. 
      Although the song has a relatively fast tempo, it leaves a dreamy and lingering impression, 
      perhaps because it deals with stories that change over time. 
      It shows that a slow and calm song is not the only way to convey nostalgia.
      The strange overlapping shots create a surreal feeling, as the clips have no clear narrative connection, 
      making the viewer feel as if they are in a dream. 
      <br><br>Since this song focuses on the concept of time, I imagine that using an old camcorder was a deliberate choice. 
      The extensive close-up shots captured with the camcorder render abstract forms, 
      further enhancing the dreamy and uncanny atmosphere.
