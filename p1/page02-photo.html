      <h4>Fleeting moments Beyond Expectation</h4>
        <p>
            Film cameras have a nostalgic appeal because you can’t see the results right away.
            After taking a shot, you forget about it, not knowing how it turned out, and only later do you get to see the image. 
            Sometimes, mistakes in handling the film keep you from capturing the subject properly, but even these accidents 
            can give a photo a new, unexpected feeling. Perhaps today, people are drawn to film for this warmth and quiet anticipation.

            , Jong-ro, is a city in Seoul that still preserves the look of the city from the 1980s/90s.
            you can especially feel the past through its old buildings and vintage signs.
            The textures of those old buildings and signs seem to blend perfectly with the grainy texture of film.

            is a small hair salon in Seongbuk-dong, located in the upper part of Seoul. 
            You can immediately tell it’s been around for a long time just by looking at its sign. 
            The letters on the sign are misspelled, but somehow that made it even more charming. 
            It felt like the kind of place that’s far from perfect, yet has regulars and a warm, lasting relationship with them over the years..
            <br><br> I’m especially fond of this photo because of the Hangul (Korean letters) sign. 
            In today’s Seoul, where such signs in Korean are slowly disappearing, this kind of scene feels precious.

            I accidentally exposed it to light, and it ended up faded like this.

            because the film got exposed to light again.. The image is so overexposed that you can’t even tell where it was taken. 
            But I liked it even more because you can still feel the film’s texture, especially along the line on the left edge.
