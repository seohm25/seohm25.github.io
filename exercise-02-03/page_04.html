            I evoke the term ‘handmade web’ in order to draw attention both to the manual labour involved 
            in the composition of web pages, and the functioning of the web page itself as a 
            'manual', a 'handbook', a set of instructions required for a computer program to run.

            <p>For most of its history web pages have been read on desktop or laptop computers. 
                Readers have had the option of right-clicking on any page, selecting View Page Source, copying, pasting, 
                and re-writing the source code. In this manner, readers become writers.
            <br><br/>

            In February 2015, Matthew Rothberg created a website called Unindexed which continuously searched Google for itself. It survived for 22 days before being indexed, at which point it was permanently deleted. Rothberg has since shared the source code on GitHub, so you too can create a website which self-destructs the moment Google indexes it.

            <br><br/>
            Dozens of readers have re-written the source code of Nick Montfort’s Taroko Gorge (2008). For many, this was their first experience 'making' a computer-generated text.
           
            <br><br/>
            I have rewritten Taroko Gorge three times. Further to the close relation between the handmade web and ephemeral print materials, excerpts of output and source code from the first iteration, Gorge (2010), were published in my very small press print book GENERATION[S] (2010), which, I believe, is now only available as a PDF. Gorge is a never-ending tract of computer-generated text spewing verse approximations, poetic paroxysms on food, consumption, decadence, and desire.
