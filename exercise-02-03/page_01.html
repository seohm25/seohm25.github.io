                I evoke the term ‘handmade web’ to refer to web pages coded by hand rather than by
                software; web pages made and maintained by individuals rather than by businesses or
                corporations; web pages which are provisional, temporary, or one-of-a-kind; web pages
                which challenge conventions of reading, writing, design, ownership, privacy, security, or
                identity.</div>

                <p>In her essay, <a href="https://art.teleportacia.org/observation/vernacular/">A Vernacular Web (2005)</a><br> Olia Lialina describes the web of the mid-1990s as:
                <br><br/><i>bright, rich, personal, slow and under construction. It was a web of sudden connections and
                personal links. Pages were built on the edge of tomorrow, full of hope for a faster connection
                and a more powerful computer... it was a web of amateurs soon to be washed away by dot.com
                ambitions, professional authoring tools and guidelines designed by usability experts.</i>
                <br><br/>

                amateur web, see: <a href="https://blog.geocities.institute/about">One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age: Digging through the Geocities Torrent.
