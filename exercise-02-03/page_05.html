            <p>Consider the manual labour carried out by the mouse hand in Daniel Eatock's The One Mile Scroll (2008) A few entries appear at the top of the screen - Denver, 
                The Mile High City - my grandfather’s grave, Denver - after that we scroll and scroll. 
                The hand is made to work. Through the labour of the body the virtual space of the browser window is transformed into an actual, physical distance.

            Ironically, handheld devices have distanced us from the handmade web. 
            In Reading Writing Interfaces: From the Digital to the Bookbound (2014), Lori Emerson argues: 
            <i>The iPad works because users can’t know how it works (15).</i>
             Reading the web on an iPhone, iPad, or similar device, readers do not have the option of viewing the page source. 
             The iPad provides consumers with access to materials created by others, but cannot easily be used as a tool in the handcrafting of new materials.
